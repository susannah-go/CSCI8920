Week 11 Problem Set

#1: The file is problem12_1.py. Upon execution the program prints a hard-coded plaintext message (line 76), prints out the encrypted plaintext, then prints out the decrypted ciphertext.

#2: The file is problem12_2.py. Upon execution the program prints a hard-coded plaintext message (line 32) and the recovered plaintext using the CRT attack. For some reason I could only get to work this under very special circumstances (small primes, short plaintext).
