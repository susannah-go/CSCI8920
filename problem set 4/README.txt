Week 4 Problem Set

1: The file is problem4_1.py. The input file w4p1.txt is hard-coded into the text. Within main there are several
 different functionalities (including using the built-in CBC mode to evaluate output of my own implementations),
 however my implementation of CBC - the objective of the assignment - is the only one uncommented.

2: The file is problem4_2.py. The input file w4p2.txt is hard-coded into the text. As before, the built-in CBC
encryption mode was used to evaluate my own implementation.

Question: ECB mode may go undetected even if the code is correct if no plaintext blocks are repeated. In this case no
blocks of ciphertext will be repeated either. Since this is our only method of identifying ECB mode, it will go
undetected.

Thank you for the extension!
