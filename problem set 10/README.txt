Week 10 Problem Set

#1: The file is problem10_1.py. Upon execution the program attempts to recover the encryption key. The key is hard-coded on line 7; the plaintext URL is on line 35. The program prints the actual key and the recovered key to the console.

#2: The file is problem10_2.py. The code was taken from http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/37648/python-implementation-of-sha1. The program performs a test case upon execution.

#3: The file is problem10_3.py. It doesn't work. :( I tried. Go cubbies!
