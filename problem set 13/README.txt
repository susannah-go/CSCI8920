CSCI 8920
Week 13 Problem Set

#1: The file is problem13_1.py. Upon execution the program: 1) prints a hard-coded plaintext message (line 45), 2) encrypts the plaintext, 3) attempts - unsuccessfully - to encrypt the plaintext a second time, and 4) prints out the result of decrypting a masked ciphertext. The result is the same as the original plaintext.

#2: The file is problem13_2.py. Upon execution the program prints out the recovered message ("NebraskaWinter").

A file named csci8920_wk13.pdf which includes my mathematical derivations has also been included.
